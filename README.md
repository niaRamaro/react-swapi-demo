# react-swapi-demo
This is a small exercise from https://github.com/KrashStudio/react-exercice.

This is the frontend, made using React, for [this custom API](https://github.com/niaRamaro/hapi-swapi) that I made.

It has 2 pages:
- A Home page from where searches can be launched
- A Detail page for the search results

Here is a live [demo](https://niaramaro.github.io/react-swapi-demo/)
